I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University, starting from Fall 2019, working with Prof. [Dimitris Samaras](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~samaras/) and Prof. [Minh Hoai Nguyen](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~minhhoai/). I am generally interested in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. Currently I am focused on human behavior analysis and multi-view problems. I obtained my Bachelor and Master's Degree from Tianjin University in 2012 and 2016, respectively. For more detailed information, please refer to my [CV](files/Qiaomu_Miao_CV.pdf). <br>
